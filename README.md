ElasticSearch Cookbook
======================

This Chef cookbook contains recipes that automatically installs and configures
ElasticSearch 1.1.1 for AWS OpsWorks instances.

Supported Platforms
===================

The installation recipe downloads appropriate packages such as .deb or .rpm
depending on your Linux platform. If you have a generic \*nix platform however,
the cookbook will still attempt to download the tarball archive and perform a
generic installation.
